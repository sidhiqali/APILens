This enhanced mock setup provides comprehensive, realistic scenarios for demonstrating APILens capabilities in an academic setting. The system generates diverse error conditions, security issues, performance problems, and breaking changes to showcase the full potential of API monitoring and change detection.

## üéØ Demo Features

### Health States & Error Scenarios
- **Critical Issues**: Authentication failures, security breaches, system crashes
- **Major Issues**: Performance degradation, data inconsistencies, external service failures  
- **Minor Issues**: Configuration drift, deprecation warnings, rate limiting
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerability detection, compliance violations, suspicious activity

### Severity Levels
- **üî¥ Critical**: Service-breaking issues requiring immediate attention
- **üü† Major**: Significant problems affecting functionality or performance
- **üü° Minor**: Warnings and non-critical issues
- **üîµ Info**: Informational messages and status updates

### Issue Categories
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, compliance violations, authentication issues
- **Performance**: Response time degradation, resource exhaustion
- **Breaking Changes**: Schema modifications, API contract violations
- **Operational**: Service outages, configuration problems
- **Deprecation**: End-of-life announcements, migration requirements

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install axios js-yaml prism-cli

# Set authentication token
export APILENS_AUTH_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Option 1: Enhanced Demo Setup (Recommended for University Demo)
```bash
# Run the enhanced demo setup script
node scripts/enhanced-demo-setup.js
```

This script creates 8 APIs with realistic scenarios:
- **User Authentication API**: Critical security issues, breaking changes
- **E-commerce Orders API**: Performance degradation, response time issues
- **Payment Processing API**: Security vulnerabilities, PCI compliance violations
- **Inventory Management API**: Data consistency problems, schema changes
- **External Weather API**: External dependency failures, rate limiting
- **Notifications Service API**: Message delivery failures, webhook issues
- **Analytics Dashboard API**: Deprecated version warnings, migration needs
- **Content Management API**: Configuration drift, environment inconsistencies

### Option 2: Enhanced Mock Servers (For Live Demo)
```bash
# Start enhanced mock servers with realistic health patterns
node orchestrator/enhanced-start-mocks.js
```

This starts 6 mock APIs with:
- **Dynamic health states** that cycle every 30 seconds
- **Realistic error patterns** based on API type
- **Comprehensive metrics** and incident history
- **Automatic version flipping** to demonstrate breaking changes

### Option 3: Standard Setup (Original)
```bash
# Register standard APIs
node scripts/register-apis.js

# Start standard mock servers
node orchestrator/start-mocks.js
```

   ps aux | grep prism
   
   # Restart enhanced mock servers
   node orchestrator/enhanced-start-mocks.js
   ```

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   ```bash
   # Verify token is set
   echo $APILENS_AUTH_TOKEN
   
   # Get new token from APILens UI
   export APILENS_AUTH_TOKEN="new_token_here"
   ```

3. **"No changes detected"**
   - Enhanced setup includes automatic version flipping
   - Changes occur every 1.5-6 minutes depending on API
   - Check timeline in demo scenarios above

4. **"Port conflicts"**
   ```bash
   # Check port usage
   lsof -i :4101-4108
   
   # Kill conflicting processes
   pkill -f prism
   ```

### Performance Optimization
